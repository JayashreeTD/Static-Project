<h4><i>Namada chilume</i></h4>

<p>
Namada Chilume (pronounced naamada chilume' in Kannada) is a natural spring situated by Devarayanadurga, near Tumkur in the state of Karnataka in India.The spring issues from the surface of the rock. It is believed that Rama, along with Sita and Lakshmana, stayed here during their exile in the forest. Rama searched for water to apply tilaka to his forehead. When he could not find any water, he shot an arrow at the rock. The arrow penetrated the rock, made a hole, and the water came out. Henceforth, this place was called Namada Chilume, meaning "Spring of Tilak". (naama = tilak and chilume' = spring, in Kannada) As shown in the picture, the water comes out from a small hole throughout the year and never dries up. The water that comes out is considered as sacred water (tirtha). It is approximately 14 km from Tumkur and 80 km from Bengaluru.<br/>

It is believed that Lord Rama along with his wife Seetha were staying here and when Lord Rama wanted to apply Tilak ( Called nama in local language) he needed water.</p><br/><br/><br/><br/>

<h4><i>Mandargiri Hills </i></h4>
<img src="images/mandharagiri.jpg" height="200" width="200" align="left"/>
<p>
Mandargiri Hills in Tumkur is the perfect weekend drive from Bangalore, if you're up for adventure, culture, and a rather beautiful Jain Temple that will have you gaping in awe. 

The hill, also known as Basadi Betta locally, is more of a hillock that the hills that dot the backyard of Bangalore. It's an easy hillock to scale up thanks to the 450-odd carved steps. It shouldn't take you more than 15 minutes to reach the top. The views aren't spectacular or anything, but you do get a panoramic view of the village Pandithanahalli. The summit has four temples which were constructed between the 12th and 14th century. There's also a small pond to dip your toes in. 

Once you are back to the base, do not miss out on what is arguably the hills most famous architecture - the pinchi-shaped 81-feet tall Guru Mandir. A pinchi is a peacock feather fan for the uninitiated, and yes, the temple is as beautiful as it can get with all bright hues of blue, green, and orange on the feather-shaped dome. Take plenty of pictures. There's also a tall statue of Chandranatha Thirthankara which is a smaller scale model of the Gommateshwara statue at Shravanabelagola. </p><br/><br/>
